  prompt: 'Enhance `orchestration/run.py` to:

    - On exceptions or user-marked errors, stop execution and log an `ERROR_TASK`
    event.

    - Add an `issues` list to the task detail YAML, appending an entry with `timestamp`,
    `type`, and `detail` when errors occur.

    - Require manual intervention to change a task from `ERROR` back to `READY`.

    - Re-evaluate dependencies so that tasks whose prerequisites are now `DONE` become
    `READY`.
