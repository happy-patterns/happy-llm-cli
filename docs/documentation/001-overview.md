# Project Overview

The Happy LLM CLI is a Python-based command-line application designed to streamline interactions with large language models (LLMs). It features:

- A modular provider architecture (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- A flexible orchestration system to manage development tasks.
- YAML-driven runbook and task definitions for auditability and control.
- Integration points for AI-assisted code generation.

This repository contains:

- `/happy_llm_cli/` – core CLI source code.
- `/orchestration/` – orchestration tooling (runbook, tasks, run.py).
- `/docs/planning/` – development plan and task orchestration documentation.
