Okay, let's look up the recommended VS Code and linter settings for Python development, focusing on current best practices as of April 20, 2025. The landscape evolves, but certain tools and approaches have become standard.
Okay, here are recommendations for VS Code settings and linter configurations suitable for your Python project as of April 20, 2025. The Python tooling ecosystem has evolved rapidly, and the current best practice emphasizes speed and integration.

**Core Recommendations:**

1. **Linter & Formatter:** **Ruff**. As highlighted in the search results, Ruff has become the dominant tool. It's extremely fast (written in Rust) and combines the functionality of multiple older tools like Flake8, Black, isort, pyupgrade, and many Flake8 plugins into one package. It's highly configurable via `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Static Type Checker:** **MyPy**. It remains the standard for static type checking in Python, crucial for catching type errors before runtime, especially since your plans involve type hints.

**VS Code Extensions:**

You'll want these extensions installed in VS Code:

1. **Python** (Microsoft): The essential base extension for Python support (IntelliSense, debugging, environment management).
2. **Pylance** (Microsoft): Usually included with the Python extension. Provides fast, feature-rich language support, including type checking powered by Pyright (which complements MyPy) directly in the editor.
3. **Ruff** (charliermarsh / Astral): The official extension for Ruff. Integrates Ruff's linting and formatting capabilities directly into VS Code, providing diagnostics, quick fixes, and formatting actions.
4. **MyPy Type Checker** (Microsoft): Integrates MyPy into VS Code, allowing it to run checks and display type errors directly in the editor and Problems pane.

**Configuration:**

The modern standard is to configure these tools within your `pyproject.toml` file at the project root.

**1. `pyproject.toml` Configuration:**

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[tool.ruff]
# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.10+ for modern syntax compatibility (adjust as needed for your target Python)
target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (F), pycodestyle (E, W), isort (I)
# Also add: flake8-bugbear (B), flake8-annotations (ANN), flake8-tidy-imports (TID)
# Feel free to add more rule sets as needed. Start broad, then ignore specific rules if necessary.
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I", "B", "ANN", "TID"]

# Optionally ignore specific rules globally (e.g., maybe ANN101 for missing 'self' type hints if you disagree)
# ignore = ["ANN101"]

# Allow unused variables in __init__.py files (common pattern)
# per-file-ignores = { "__init__.py" = ["F401"] }

# If using the `src` layout
src = ["src"]

[tool.ruff.format]
# Use Ruff's formatter (similar to Black)
# Options: "py", "ipynb", "toml", "yaml" (as of recent versions)
# You might only need python for now.
include = ["*.py", "*.pyi"]
# Exclude files if needed, e.g. auto-generated files
# exclude = []

# Docstring formatting is optional but can be nice
# docstring-code-format = true

[tool.mypy]
# MyPy configuration
python_version = "3.10" # Match your target Python version
pretty = true
show_error_codes = true
# Enable strict checks (Good goal, but can be demanding initially)
# strict = true
# OR, enable specific checks incrementally:
disallow_untyped_defs = true     # Ensure functions are annotated
check_untyped_defs = true        # Type check the interior of functions without annotations
warn_return_any = true           # Warns if a function returns Any when it could be more specific
warn_unused_ignores = true       # Warn about '# type: ignore' comments that are no longer needed
no_implicit_optional = true      # Don't assume 'None' is valid for types unless explicitly Union[X, None] or Optional[X]

# Tell MyPy where your source code is (important for imports)
# Adjust if your structure is different
mypy_path = "src"
files = ["src"] # Specify paths or packages to check

# Ignore missing imports for libraries that don't have type hints (or install stubs for them)
# ignore_missing_imports = true # Use sparingly, better to install stubs if available

# Show column numbers in error messages
show_column_numbers = true

# Follow imports to check dependent modules (can be 'normal', 'silent', 'skip', 'error')
follow_imports = "normal"

```

**2. VS Code Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):**

Create a `.vscode` folder in your project root if it doesn't exist, and add a `settings.json` file inside it. This file contains settings specific to this project/workspace.

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
    // --- Python Extension Settings ---
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic", // Or "strict". 'basic' relies more on Pylance's checks, 'strict' might integrate MyPy more directly depending on extension version.
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",

    // --- Ruff Extension Settings (Primary Linter/Formatter) ---
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff", // Set Ruff as the default formatter
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,                   // Format files automatically when you save
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll": "explicit",             // Apply Ruff's automatic fixes on save
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit"     // Organize imports using Ruff on save
        }
    },
    "ruff.lint.args": [], // Add any command-line args for Ruff linting if needed
    "ruff.format.args": [], // Add any command-line args for Ruff formatting if needed
    // Ensure Ruff uses the config from pyproject.toml (usually automatic)
    // "ruff.config": "${workspaceFolder}/pyproject.toml", // Usually not needed unless config is elsewhere

    // --- MyPy Type Checker Extension Settings ---
    "mypy-type-checker.args": ["--config-file=${workspaceFolder}/pyproject.toml"], // Tell extension where config is
    "mypy-type-checker.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment", // Use mypy installed in your virtual env
    // "mypy-type-checker.path": ["path/to/mypy/if/not/in/venv/path"], // Usually not needed if using venv
    "mypy-type-checker.reportingScope": "file", // Check the current file
    "mypy-type-checker.runUsingActiveInterpreter": true, // Recommended

    // --- General Editor Settings ---
    "files.eol": "\n", // Ensure consistent line endings
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
    "files.insertFinalNewline": true,

    // --- Optional: Disable older/redundant linters if Python ext enables them ---
    "python.linting.enabled": true, // Keep master switch on if other tools used
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false, // Disable if using Ruff primarily
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": false, // Disable if using Ruff primarily
    "python.formatting.provider": "none" // Let the Ruff extension handle formatting via defaultFormatter
}

```

**Explanation and Benefits:**

* **Consistency:** Ruff (as formatter) enforces a consistent code style (like Black) automatically on save.
* **Error Detection:** Ruff (as linter) catches a wide range of potential bugs, style issues, and anti-patterns based on the rules you enable. MyPy catches type-related errors that linters often miss.
* **Speed:** Ruff is significantly faster than running Flake8, Black, and isort separately. MyPy is focused solely on type checking.
* **Integration:** The VS Code extensions show errors directly inline and in the "Problems" pane. Ruff provides quick fixes for many issues (`source.fixAll`).
* **Configuration Standard:** Using `pyproject.toml` is the modern standard for configuring Python development tools.
* **Automation:** Formatting and fixing on save reduces manual effort and keeps the codebase clean continuously.

**To Get Started:**

1. Make sure you have a virtual environment (`.venv`) activated for your project.
2. Install the tools: `pip install ruff mypy` (add these to your development requirements, e.g., `requirements-dev.txt`).
3. Install the recommended VS Code extensions listed above.
4. Create/update `pyproject.toml` with the configuration sections.
5. Create/update `.vscode/settings.json` with the editor integration settings.
6. Reload VS Code (`Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette) to ensure all settings and extensions are loaded correctly.

This setup provides a robust, fast, and modern development environment for your Python project in VS Code as of April 2025. Remember to check the specific documentation for the Ruff and MyPy VS Code extensions, as settings might evolve slightly with new versions.
